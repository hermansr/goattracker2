To build under MacOS 11 (intel) and later:

1. Install libsdl, for instance by using brew:
   (if you don't already have brew installed, consult the internet)
    >brew install sdl

2. Install Xcode command line developer tools:
    >xcode-select --install

3. Clone or unarchive GoatTracker and cd to the 'src' folder:
    goattracker2>cd src 

4. Build GT2 by running make:
    src>make 

5. cd to the 'linux' folder and copy or run 'goattrk2':
    src>cd ..
    goattracker2>cd linux
    linux>./goattrk2

    ..or copy to your desktop:

    src>cp ../linux/goattrk2 $HOME/Desktop 

Enjoy!
